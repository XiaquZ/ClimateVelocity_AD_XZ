# ClimateVelocity_AD_XZ
Climate velocity scripts for sharing and microclimate data of Belgium for testing.  
First of all, thanks a lot for contributing to the scripts! :)  
1. Under MicroclimateData folder you will find the present time and future time microclimate data of Belgium. These data are all represent the forest mean annual microclimate temperature (BIO1). Data are available in two projection: WGS84 (unit in degree), EPSG3035 (Unit in meter).  
2. In R scripts folder there are scripts for Great Circle method (GC_dVoCC_modifiedAD_XZ.R), Euclidean distance method(EuclideanDistance_VoCC.R) and least cost path method (TwoLayerResist_FVoCC_TestForFragmented.R). Two scripts in supercomputer version are also added under Supercomputer folder.
